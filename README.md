# CHECKMARK
An Eloquently developed Copyright, Patents, and Trademark, database. Indexing an incredibly large array of of data, for users to review and reference.

## Usage
Checkmark can be used to index whether copyright, patent, or trademark exists. It can be cross referenced to ensure you are compliant on your own project
that might be a violation of one of these sections. whether you're an entrepreneur, artist, musgician, developer or etc. This indexed list assorted in user-friendly
formats and layouts, can be a great tool to keep malicious companies, patent trolls, or copyright claims from coming your way trying to take advantage.

You can also use checkmark to see what copyrights, patents, or trademarks are expiring soon. Additionally your usage can help you see trends on what companies, and
others might be doing right now, as these documents, and datasets can be very informative on what an entity such as a company or business is thinking and planning out.

## Tech Stack Choice:
- MariaDB: *Chosen over NoSQL DB's, for it's maturity, its ability to optimize queries, usage of ACID, flexibility with indexing, structured sql architecture, and security too*
- ExpressJS: *Used for endpoint creation, and management as its flexible, lightweight, modular, secure, and scaleable as well*
- Angular 17: *Used for it's opinionated architecture and usage of rxJS, as this is a heavily endpointed index, mantaining everything in a seperated, well defined architecture with services is perfect here as well*
- NodeJS: *Used for most back-end related tasks, setting up endpoints, querying the database, monitoring, and security implementations as well*
- Python: *Used to manage the SQL DB, Update its data, Scrape for resources, Update specific parts of the project as needed, secured, seperates concerns, which allows for ease of scaleability, and finally of course its incredible eco-system for AI as well as Data Analysis*
- Linode: *Best affordable hosting provider with a decent range of tools for managing and securing our servers as well*
